## ðŸ“Œ Overview

**3DKeyAD** is a 3D anomaly detection method in high-resolution point clouds.

---

## âœ¨ Highlights

- âœ… Multi-prototype rigid registration ensures consistent spatial alignment
- âœ… Keypoint-guided clustering focuses on geometrically informative regions
- âœ… Cluster-wise feature comparison supports raw, FPFH, and PointMAE features
- âœ… SOTA results on [Real3D-AD](https://github.com/M-3LAB/Real3D-AD) dataset
